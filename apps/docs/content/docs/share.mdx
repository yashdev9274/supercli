# Share

Share your Supercode conversations.

Supercode’s share feature lets you create public links to conversations so you can collaborate or get help from others.

> **Note:** Shared conversations are publicly accessible to anyone with the link.

## How it works

When you share a conversation, Supercode:

1. Creates a unique public URL for your session
2. Syncs your conversation history to the servers
3. Makes the conversation available at the shareable link (e.g. `supercli.com/s/<share-id>`)

## Sharing modes

### Manual (default)

By default, sharing is manual. Sessions are not shared automatically. Use the `/share` command to share:

```
/share
```

This generates a URL and copies it to your clipboard.

To set manual mode explicitly in your [config](/docs/config):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://supercode.ai/config.json",
  "share": "manual"
}
```

### Auto-share

Enable automatic sharing for all new conversations:

```json
{
  "share": "auto"
}
```

Every new conversation will be shared and a link will be generated.

### Disabled

Disable sharing entirely:

```json
{
  "share": "disabled"
}
```

To enforce this for a project, add it to `opencode.json` in the project and commit to Git.

## Un-sharing

To stop sharing and remove a conversation from public access:

```
/unshare
```

This removes the share link and deletes the related data.

## Privacy

### Data retention

Shared conversations stay accessible until you unshare them. This includes full conversation history, all messages and responses, and session metadata.

### Recommendations

- Only share conversations that don’t contain sensitive information.
- Review content before sharing.
- Unshare when collaboration is done.
- Avoid sharing proprietary code or confidential data.
- For sensitive projects, disable sharing in config.

## For enterprises

For enterprise deployments, sharing can be disabled for compliance, restricted to SSO users only, or self-hosted on your own infrastructure.

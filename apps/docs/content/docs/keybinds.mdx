# Keybinds

Customize your keybinds.

Supercode has a list of keybinds you can customize in your config.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://supercode.ai/config.json",
  "keybinds": {
    "leader": "ctrl+x",
    "app_exit": "ctrl+c,ctrl+d,<leader>q",
    "editor_open": "<leader>e",
    "theme_list": "<leader>t",
    "sidebar_toggle": "<leader>b",
    "session_new": "<leader>n",
    "session_list": "<leader>l",
    "agent_list": "<leader>a",
    "agent_cycle": "tab",
    "agent_cycle_reverse": "shift+tab",
    "command_list": "ctrl+p",
    "input_submit": "return",
    "input_newline": "shift+return,ctrl+return,alt+return",
    "input_clear": "ctrl+c",
    "input_paste": "ctrl+v",
    "messages_undo": "<leader>u",
    "messages_redo": "<leader>r",
    "model_list": "<leader>m"
  }
}
```

## Leader key

Most keybinds use a **leader** key to avoid conflicts. The default leader is `ctrl+x`. Many actions are **leader** then another key (e.g. leader + `n` for new session).

You don’t have to use a leader, but it’s recommended.

## Disable a keybind

Set a keybind to `"none"` to disable it:

```json
{
  "keybinds": {
    "session_compact": "none"
  }
}
```

## Desktop prompt shortcuts

The desktop app prompt supports Readline/Emacs-style shortcuts (e.g. `ctrl+a` start of line, `ctrl+e` end of line, `ctrl+k` kill to end of line). These are built-in and not configurable via config.

## Shift+Enter

Some terminals don’t send modifier keys with Enter. You may need to configure your terminal to send `Shift+Enter` as an escape sequence. On Windows Terminal, you can add a custom keybinding that sends `\u001b[13;2u` for Shift+Enter.

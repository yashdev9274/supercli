# Zen

Curated list of models provided by Supercode.

Supercode Zen is a list of tested and verified models provided by the team.

> **Note:** Supercode Zen is currently in beta.

Zen works like any other provider. You log in and get your API key. It's **completely optional**.

## Background

There are many models but only a few work well as coding agents. Most providers are configured differently, so you get very different performance and quality.

To fix this:

1. We tested a select group of models and talked to their teams about how to best run them.
2. We worked with providers to ensure they were served correctly.
3. We benchmarked model/provider combinations and came up with a list we recommend.

Supercode Zen is an AI gateway that gives you access to these models.

## How it works

1. Sign in to Supercode Zen, add your billing details, and copy your API key.
2. Run `/connect` in the TUI, select Zen, and paste your API key.
3. Run `/models` in the TUI to see the list of recommended models.

You are charged per request and can add credits to your account.

## Endpoints

You can access models through API endpoints. The model id in your config uses the format `opencode/<model-id>`.

## Pricing

We support pay-as-you-go. Prices are per 1M tokens. See the dashboard for current pricing.

## Privacy

Models are hosted in the US. Providers follow a zero-retention policy and do not use your data for model training, with documented exceptions for some free tiers.

## For Teams

Zen works for teams. You can invite teammates, assign roles, and curate the models your team uses. Workspaces are currently free for teams during the beta.

### Roles

- **Admin**: Manage models, members, API keys, and billing
- **Member**: Manage only their own API keys

Admins can set monthly spending limits per member.

### Model access

Admins can enable or disable specific models for the workspace.

### Bring your own key

You can use your own OpenAI or Anthropic API keys while still accessing other models in Zen. When you use your own keys, tokens are billed directly by the provider.

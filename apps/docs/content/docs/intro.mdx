# Intro

Get started with Supercode.

**Supercode** is an open source AI coding agent. It's available as a terminal-based interface, desktop app, or IDE extension.

Let's get started.

## Prerequisites

To use Supercode in your terminal, you'll need:

1. A modern terminal emulator like:
   - WezTerm — cross-platform
   - Alacritty — cross-platform
   - Ghostty — Linux and macOS
   - Kitty — Linux and macOS
2. API keys for the LLM providers you want to use.

## Install

The easiest way to install is through the install script.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://supercli.com/install | bash
```

You can also install with:

- **Using Node.js**: `npm install -g supercode-ai`, `bun install -g supercode-ai`, `pnpm add -g supercode-ai`, or `yarn global add supercode-ai`
- **Using Homebrew on macOS and Linux**: `brew install supercode/tap/supercode`
- **Using Paru on Arch Linux**: `paru -S supercode-bin`

### Windows

**Recommended: Use WSL**

For the best experience on Windows, we recommend using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](/docs/windows-wsl). It provides better performance and full compatibility.

You can also grab the binary from the Releases page.

## Configure

With Supercode you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys.

If you are new to using LLM providers, we recommend using **Supercode Zen** — a curated list of models tested and verified by the team.

1. Run the `/connect` command in the TUI, select your provider, and head to the auth page.
2. Sign in, add your billing details, and copy your API key.
3. Paste your API key.

Alternatively, you can select one of the other providers. [Learn more](/docs/providers).

## Initialize

Now that you've configured a provider, navigate to a project and run:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
supercode
```

Initialize Supercode for the project:

```
/init
```

This will analyze your project and create an `AGENTS.md` file in the project root.

> **Tip:** Commit your project's `AGENTS.md` to Git. This helps Supercode understand the project structure and coding patterns.

## Usage

You are now ready to use Supercode. Feel free to ask it anything!

### Ask questions

You can ask Supercode to explain the codebase. Use the `@` key to fuzzy search for files in the project.

### Add features

You can ask Supercode to add new features. We recommend asking it to create a plan first using **Plan mode** (Tab key), then switch back to **Build mode** and ask it to make the changes.

### Make changes

For straightforward changes, ask Supercode to implement directly. Provide enough detail so it makes the right changes.

### Undo changes

Use the `/undo` command to revert changes, or `/redo` to redo them.

## Share

Conversations can be [shared with your team](/docs/share) using the `/share` command. This creates a link to the current conversation and copies it to your clipboard.

## Customize

To make it your own, we recommend [picking a theme](/docs/themes), [customizing keybinds](/docs/keybinds), [configuring formatters](/docs/formatters), [creating custom commands](/docs/commands), or editing the [config](/docs/config).

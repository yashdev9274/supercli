# Windows (WSL)

Run Supercode on Windows using WSL for the best experience.

Supercode can run directly on Windows, but we recommend [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for the best experience. WSL gives you a Linux environment that works well with Supercode’s features.

**Why WSL?** Better file system performance, full terminal support, and compatibility with the tools Supercode relies on.

## Setup

1. **Install WSL**  
   If needed, [install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) using the official Microsoft guide.

2. **Install Supercode in WSL**  
   Open your WSL terminal and install Supercode using one of the [installation methods](/docs/intro):

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://supercli.com/install | bash
   ```

3. **Use Supercode from WSL**  
   Go to your project directory (Windows drives are under `/mnt/c/`, `/mnt/d/`, etc.) and run Supercode:

   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/project
   supercode
   ```

## Desktop App + WSL Server

If you use the Supercode Desktop app but want the server in WSL:

1. **Start the server in WSL** with `--hostname 0.0.0.0` so the app can connect:

   ```bash
   supercode serve --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 4096
   ```

2. **Connect the Desktop app** to `http://localhost:4096`.

   If `localhost` doesn’t work, use the WSL IP from WSL (`hostname -I`) and connect to `http://<wsl-ip>:4096`.

> **Caution:** When using `--hostname 0.0.0.0`, set `SUPERCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` to secure the server.

## Web Client + WSL

For the best web experience on Windows:

1. Run **`supercode web`** in the WSL terminal (not PowerShell):

   ```bash
   supercode web --hostname 0.0.0.0
   ```

2. Open your Windows browser at the URL printed (e.g. `http://localhost:<port>`).

Running `supercode web` from WSL keeps file system and terminal behavior correct while you use the browser on Windows.

## Accessing Windows files

WSL can access Windows drives under `/mnt/`:

- `C:` → `/mnt/c/`
- `D:` → `/mnt/d/`
- etc.

Example:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/Documents/project
supercode
```

**Tip:** For the smoothest experience, clone or copy your repo into the WSL filesystem (e.g. under `~/code/`) and run Supercode there.

## Tips

- Keep Supercode running in WSL for projects on Windows drives — file access works seamlessly.
- Use VS Code’s [WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) with Supercode for an integrated workflow.
- Config and sessions live in WSL at `~/.local/share/supercode/`.

# Commands

Create custom commands for repetitive tasks.

Custom commands let you specify a prompt that runs when you execute the command in the TUI.

```
/my-command
```

Custom commands are in addition to built-in commands like `/init`, `/undo`, `/redo`, `/share`, `/help`.

## Create command files

Create markdown files in the `commands/` directory to define custom commands.

Example `.opencode/commands/test.md`:

```md
---
description: Run tests with coverage
agent: build
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
---
Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.
Focus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.
```

The frontmatter defines command properties. The content becomes the template. Use the command by typing `/` followed by the command name: `/test`.

## Configure

You can add custom commands through the config or by creating markdown files in the `commands/` directory.

### JSON

Use the `command` option in your [config](/docs/config):

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://supercode.ai/config.json",
  "command": {
    "test": {
      "template": "Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.\\nFocus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.",
      "description": "Run tests with coverage",
      "agent": "build",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    }
  }
}
```

### Markdown

Place command files in:

- Global: `~/.config/supercode/commands/`
- Per-project: `.opencode/commands/`

The filename (without `.md`) becomes the command name (e.g. `test.md` → `/test`).

## Prompt config

### Arguments

Use the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder to pass arguments. For example, `/component Button` replaces `$ARGUMENTS` with `Button`. You can also use `$1`, `$2`, `$3` for positional arguments.

### Shell output

Use **!`command`** to inject shell command output into the prompt. Commands run in the project root.

### File references

Use `@path/to/file` to include file content in the command prompt.

## Options

- **template** — Required. The prompt sent to the LLM when the command runs.
- **description** — Shown in the TUI when you type the command.
- **agent** — Optional. Which [agent](/docs/config#agents) runs the command. Defaults to the current agent.
- **subtask** — Optional. Set to `true` to force the command to run as a subagent.
- **model** — Optional. Override the model for this command.

## Built-in

Supercode includes built-in commands like `/init`, `/undo`, `/redo`, `/share`, `/help`. Custom commands can override built-in ones if you define a command with the same name.
